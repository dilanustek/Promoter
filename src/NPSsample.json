I swear no one in Turkish airlines customer service helped me to get this issued fixed. They told me I lost my business class and my money.  Be warned, I swear I had horrible anxiety from it especially that my flight is 14 hours on plane, they kept hanging up phone on me. I opened complain ticket they did not help me, I opened an objection, they pass it to higher level customer service who refused to even do anything about it.  Three agents on the ground before my flight admitted that Turkish airlines system made a mistake, they called customer service who refuse to discuss it.  *If you have enough evidence against this LOL-Customer-Services. Call your bank and open an objection case, attach evidence files with your tickets and request refund.  *Turkish airlines do not follow their policy. Their website and app is full of bugs and errors, their system will take your money in a fault request. No one would help you there. Be warned!",

It's feature rich, with nearly all the features of the desktop website and it works with grace and elegance. It looks nice and is intuitive to use. Sure there are a couple of issues such as it doesn't stay logged into M&S and it doesn't properly implement some aspects of material design guidelines (mainly animations and layouts) but overall this is a great app, certainly 4-5 stars and no less.

Do it in other ways if you want to fly this airline. TK is now following same as CX to promote worst app in this world. Look at the Alaska Airlines app. They are the best!",
